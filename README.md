Charitable is a powerful, extendable fundraising plugin created to help non-profits accept donations on their own website. 

## Description

[Charitable](http://wpcharitable.com/) is the WordPress fundraising alternative for non-profits, built to help non-profits raise money on their own website. 

You can accept PayPal or offline donations right out of the box, with support for other gateways available as extensions.

### Easy to use

Install, activate and create your first fundraising campaign in less than 5 minutes. With Charitable, adding campaigns is a straightforward, intuitive process. Less time setting up campaigns means more time for you to raise awareness for your campaign.

### Unlimited fundraising campaigns 

You can set up as many campaigns as you'd like with Charitable, and you can tailor them to your needs. You can set up suggested donation amounts, allow them to donate as much as they want, or do both.

Need to set a fundraising goal? No problem. 

Running a time-sensitive campaign? Set an end date for your campaign and give it a sense of urgency.

### Skip the transaction fees 

Other fundraising software charges you for every donation you receive. 

Charitable is different. We won't charge you any transaction fees and you can use Charitable for free.

### Works with any theme 

Charitable has been designed to work with any well-coded theme, including the default WordPress themes.

### Extensions 

One size does *not* fit all. That's why we made Charitable an extendable platform. 

* **Anonymous Donations** - Allow people to make donations anonymously.
* **User Avatars** - Let your donors upload their own profile photo to your site, instead of using their Gravatar profile.
* **Simple Updates** - Add updates about your fundraising campaigns.
